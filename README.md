Paintball Trajectory Calculator
=

This is the paintball trajectory calculator created by Gary Dyrkacz, found via the wayback machine. I don't know if, or how, it works yet, but at least the code is now accessible online. Code is his, not mine.

In the future this doc will contain install and usage instructions. 

Praise be to Velcor.
